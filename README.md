## Introduction

##### A Chrome Extension to better navigate your browsing journey.

Magayana is a small extension to help me keep tracking of my browsing 'journeys'. Think of a journey as a deep dive on a particular topic manifesting as a group of tabs in a window. I found that I had multiple chrome windows open with different topics, hence building a small extension to help me keep track of them (and suspend/revive them when needed). 

Simply put, more journeys in magayana, less windows open on your desktop!

## Installation

Magayana isn't available on the Chrome Web Store, so you'll need to install it manually.
1. Navigate to chrome://extensions via address bar.
2. Click the "Load Unpacked" button.
3. Navigate to where you've downloaded/pulled Magayana and select the folder.
4. You're ready to go!

## Future

I'm thinking about a second release which isn't as bare-bones, which will hopefully be up on the Web Store so watch this space.
